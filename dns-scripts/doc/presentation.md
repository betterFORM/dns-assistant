# Presentation of prototype

Possible flow of presentation of the prototype:

1. start with running eXistdb
1. open up app url in browser
1. say some words about the webapp itself like: is build with state-of-the-art webtechnologies (cross-browser, responsive)
1. explain the UI - defaults, zones, help section
1. show defaults and explain it
1. add a new zone
1. edit a zone
1. store it and trigger generation of zone file
1. show generated zone file (probably we should display it in the browser instead of just opening it on filesystem - might be more convincing)
1. show that file landed in CVS
1. show import of existing files (results should be displayed in UI
1. say something about DNSsec
