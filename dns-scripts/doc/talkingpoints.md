# Talking Points

Some statements that may convince $CUSTOMER of our tool:

- the Web GUI eliminates manual editing of zonefiles which is error-prone
(syntax errors, forgot to update serial, etc)
- fully integrates with existing config and procedures at $CUSTOMER (config 
files, named.reload, CVS backend)
- coexists with traditional manual editing procedures
- allows customers of $CUSTOMER to modify their zones themselves, integrates 
with new management tools at $CUSTOMER, same look+feel
- all DNS record types used at $CUSTOMER are supported, even the uncommon 
ones like AAAA, SPF, TXT, SRV
- simplifies common tasks, even complex ones (eg "Hidden Primary", "Reverse 
Delegation")
- support for DNSSEC - great opportunity to deploy DNSSEC at $CUSTOMER
- support for DANE (TLS certificates in DNS)
- uses tools from the BIND software used at $CUSTOMER instead of reinventing 
our own
